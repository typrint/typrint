# TyPrint

Your Ultimate CMS, Modern, Fast and Powerful.

## What is TyPrint?

TyPrint is a CMS (Content Management System) that is designed to be very fast and powerful, powered
by [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Swow](https://github.com/swow/swow).

## Why we develop TyPrint?

Since the conflict between WordPress and WP Engine in September 2024, we realized that we need a "backup" CMS, so we
developed TyPrint.
